### Philippe Yu
Hello, I'm Philippe Yu. I'm working on several different projects that will eventually be published on the app store. I am also studying Computer Science. 


### Current Apps
So far, I have one app on the apps store. Inventory Made Simple. It allows stores and regular people to track inventory easily. 

### Other website
I have a second website that you can see, it is more focused on my apps. I also have a learn to code blog with great tutorials that you can check out.


### GitHub demo apps
I have made some demo apps that I've put on my GitHub profile. They are meant to show what I am capable of. I did not spend much time on the UI though.
