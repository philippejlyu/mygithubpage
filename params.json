I am also studying Computer Science. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Current Apps\r\nSo far, I have one app on the apps store. Inventory Made Simple. It allows stores and regular people to track inventory easily. \r\n\r\n### Other website\r\nI have a second website that you can see, it is more focused on my apps. I also have a learn to code blog with great tutorials that you can check out.\r\n\r\n\r\n### GitHub demo apps\r\nI have made some demo apps that I've put on my GitHub profile. They are meant to show what I am capable of. I did not spend much time on the UI though. \r\n\r\n[Barcode Scanner from Inventory Made Simple] (https://github.com/philippejlyu/Barcode-scanner)",
