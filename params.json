I am also studying Computer Science. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Current Apps\r\nSo far, I have one app on the apps store. Inventory Made Simple. It allows stores and regular people to track inventory easily. \r\n\r\n### Other website\r\nI have a second website that you can see, it is more focused on my apps. I also have a learn to code blog with great tutorials that you can check out.\r\n\r\n",
